-> git commit - this will make a commit with whatever changes have been staged. However,
it will try and use a default editor,  most students don't have one congifured, it will	
open up VIM (not a very beginner friendly editor) in your terminal (use ;Q to get out of it)

-> git commit -m "add message here" - 

-> git log - retrieves information like "git status"
